# Dashboard of Data Professionals Survey

Do data analysts hate their jobs? In 2022, [Alex Freberg](https://www.alextheanalyst.com/) conducted a survey of professionals in the field of Data Analysis. He asked them questions, like how difficult it was to break into Data Analysis and how happy they were with their current salary and their potential for upward mobility. I used Power BI to clean the data and create a dashboard visualizing results and insights of the survey.

The original, uncleaned data can be found in the included Excel file.
